ðŸ“ŒAbout Us

We are a drug discovery team with an interest in the development of publicly available open-source customizable cheminformatics tools
to be used in computer-assisted drug discovery. We belong to the Laboratory of Bioactive Research and Development (LIDeB) of the
National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. Our research group is focused on computer-guided drug repurposing and rational discovery
of new drug candidates to treat epilepsy and neglected tropical diseases.

Clustering of molecules implies the organization of a group of molecules into smaller subgroups (clusters) with similar features.
Typical applications of this methodology involve the representative splitting of datasets for QSAR and the selection of representative
in silico hits from in silico screening experiments for acquisition and submission to experimental confirmation.
iRaPCA Clustering is a clustering strategy based on an iterative combination of the random subspace approach (feature bagging),
dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the k-means algorithm. The optimal number of clusters k and
the best subset of descriptors are selected from plots of silhouette coefficient against different k values and subsets.
Different validation metrics can be downloaded once the process have finished. A number of graphs may be built and readily downloaded
through a simple click.
